        <p>My name is Karina Freeland. During my childhood I moved across the nation because my dad was in the Marine
            Corps. This led to me having a <strong> fascination with cities and how they interact with people </strong>.
            During my time in the south I became aware if the truth of social inequalities which led me to apply to the
            Maxwell School at Syrcause University in hopes of one day pursing policy of social justice. </p>
        <p>Currently I am a <strong> Junior Policy Studies major at Syracuse University </strong>. During my time at the
            university I have become interested in smart cities and urban planning.This has led me to <strong>work with
                the City of Syracuse and do research on the Canadian Smart City Challenge </strong>. One day I hope to
            be a project manager for Smart City iniciatives which is why I am minoring in the i-school.</p>

        <p>Outside of school I love to</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake</li>
            <li>See friends</li>
            <li>Read</li>
        </ul>
        <p>in my free time. I just finished "Born a Crime" and would love to hear any book suggestions you have!
        <strong>I am looking forward to this class, but truthfully am very nervous because code is not my strong
            suit.</strong>
