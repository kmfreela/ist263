    My name is Karina Freeland and I am a Junior Policy Studies major at Syracuse University. 
    I am interested in smart cities and urban planning which has led me to work with the City of Syracuse and do research on the Canadian Smart City Challenge. 
    One day I hope to be a project manager for Smart City iniciatives which is why I am minoring in the i-school. 
    Outside of school I love to swim, see friends, and read in my free time. 
    I just finished "Born a Crime" and would love to hear any book suggestions you have! 
    I am looking forward to this class, but truthfully am very nervous because code is not my strong suit.
